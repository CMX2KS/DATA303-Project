For the most part, however, it appears that no track is very strongly correlated with score.

Although notably, though Medicine is negatively correlated with project score in this period, a Medicine project won a single Grand Prize in this period, whereas 
categories with stronger correlations with score, like Open/Community Research, has never won a Grand Prize in any competition year.


We can visualize project success in this period by track using a similar strip plot as in the previous section, but this time re-colored by project track that year. 
You can view track performance individually by clicking on the corresponding regions in the legend on the right hand side of the plot.
