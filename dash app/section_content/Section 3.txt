As we can see in these plots as well, Europe is the highest performing region overall, with North America and Asia not far behind. It is likely part of the reason we 
see such dramatic differences in lifetime score accumulation between regions is that African and Latin American teams are much more likely to be "one-offs" - teams that 
will form to compete for one year only and never again. There are many possibilities for why this is more common amongst Latin American or African teams, one which seems 
likely to me is that institutions in these regions tend to have fewer overall resources to devote to discretionary research like iGEM, so iGEM teams from these regions 
are more likely to get axed between competition cycles. This hinders lifetime score accumulation by these teams because they simply compete less often, but also limits 
the scope of their projects, and limits experience accumulation by their advisors and participants.
Reasons for regional differences between wealthier regions like Europe, Asia, and North America are less clear, but one common refrain I have heard from a number of 
iGEM advisors is that the field of Synthetic Biology is perceived as less prestigious than in Europe, so it,s harder to attract talent and resources to North American 
and Asian iGEM teams than it is in Europe.


Of course, without additional data and analysis this is all just speculation and hearsay, the only things we can firmly conclude from this part of the analysis is that 
Europe has seen the most success in iGEM in this period, followed closely by North America and Asia, then by Latin America and Africa.


Which subcategories of research tend to be most successful at the Jamboree?
This plot visualizes the growth and evolution of the research being done by iGEM teams over time. Though we have seen significant growth in some categories, namely High 
School, some tracks tend to remain pretty consistently popular, like Environment, Basic Research, and Medicine.
